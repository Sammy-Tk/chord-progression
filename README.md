# Chords progression prediction
Takes a series of chords and outputs a progression of chords.

The model uses an LSTM neural network trained on 130,000 chord progressions from real-world songs (Kaggle dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/eitanbentora/chords-and-lyrics-dataset)

## Features
- Input: Sequence of musical chords
- Output: Predicted chord progression
- Built with Python, TensorFlow, pandas, NumPy, FastAPI and Streamlit
- Trained on a large dataset of songs
